                <p>Feeling inspired but not sure which to choose? Ask yourself these questions:</p>
                <ol class="list-group list-group-flush mb-4">
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Who is it for?</strong> First and foremost, the theme should reflect the personality and interests of the guest of honour. Do they love old movies? Are they an avid hiker? Start there.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>Who is coming?</strong> Consider your audience. An intricate murder mystery might be perfect for a group of close friends but might not work for a large family gathering with kids.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>What's your venue?</strong> A tropical luau theme is a bit tricky in a small apartment in December. Make sure your theme works with the space, season, and logistics you have available.</li>
                    <li class="list-group-item"><strong>What's your budget?</strong> Some themes can be done beautifully on a budget (like a monochrome party), while others might require more investment. Be realistic about what you can spend.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>A theme is your party's storyline. It ties everything together—from the invitations to the parting gifts—and creates a memorable, immersive experience for you and your guests. So go ahead, get creative, and plan a birthday bash that is uniquely <em>you</em>.</p>
                
                <p class="text-center text-muted fst-italic mt-5">Happy planning!</p>
